    "comment": "After thorough analysis, I vote YES on the 2025 Net Change Limit proposal of 350M ADA. My reasoning: The 350M cap strikes an optimal balance between fiscal responsibility and ecosystem growth. It matches projected treasury income, effectively implementing a balanced budget principle that preserves our ~1.64B ADA treasury while fully deploying annual yields. This approach aligns with successful sovereign wealth fund models and represents a mature evolution from Catalyst's informal limits to constitutionally-bounded governance. While I acknowledge the merit of more conservative proposals (like the 300M alternative), historical data shows 350M is sustainable - our 2024 inflow was ~336M ADA with only ~190M spent. This headroom for increased funding is crucial as Cardano scales. Most importantly, the NCL adheres to constitutional guardrails while institutionalizing fiscal discipline. It's a landmark step in decentralized treasury management, positioning Cardano ahead of peers like Polkadot who've faced challenges without formal caps. Let's build responsibly."
